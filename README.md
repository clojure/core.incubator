# core.incubator

Future home of fns proposed for core inclusion.  Currently:

* A set of short-circuiting "nil-safe" threading macros (e.g. `-?>`, `-?>>` and
  `.?.`)
* An implementation of `dissoc-in`
* An implementation of `seqable?`
* A string interpolation macro (`<<`), originally described
  [here](http://cemerick.com/2009/12/04/string-interpolation-in-clojure/).

For more details, please see the project's [generated API
documentation](http://clojure.github.com/core.incubator/).
